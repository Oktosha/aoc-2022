# aoc-2022

This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022][aoc] in Kotlin.

This is was the first time I participated in Advent of Code, and the the first time I used Kotlin (except for following some tutorials in 2020).

I solved all the challenges! Solutions aren't pretty, and the day 16 pt 2 needs about an hour to get the answer... but hey, it works! For the context, less than 5% of participants solve all the challenges (full stats [here][stats]).

The project is â‰ˆ3000 lines of code accoring to [codetabs.com][loc]. Some of this code is inherited from the [template by JetBrains][template] and some of this code is boilerplate... but it is still a decent amount of code in Kotlin.

When I participate in the Advent of Code next time, I'll probably name the repo `aoc-yyyy`, where `yyyy` indicates year. So if you are reading this from the future and are interested in my other Advent of Code participations, search for `aoc` in my repos!
